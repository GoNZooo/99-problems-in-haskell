## ninety-nine-problems

This is an implementation of some of the problems from the "99 problems" exercises:

Most of the code is actually re-implementing parts of the Haskell standard library, which is overall
more interesting than solving the problems themselves.

See `Library.hs` for solutions. See all the other files for standard library implementations.
